        		<h1>Curated Thoughts of a Chaotic Mind</h1>
				<p>As I lay on my bed on a lazy Sunday afternoon staring at the ceiling fan, contemplating about my life and about John F. Kennedy’s, I figured I need to do something. I had just finished Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning and suddenly I felt an urge to finally start writing on this website, which is intended to serve as an abode to my (and what possibly could have been John F. Kennedy’s) two cents on films, filmmakers, actors, books, science, philosophy, music and more. Now I am not obsessed with John F. Kennedy but boy, was he a charmer! Okay, that’s it, that’s the last time I mention him (or do I?).
<br>Look around, I hope you will find your cup of coffee.</p>
